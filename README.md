# Serverless Computer Vision Pipeline

## Introduction

This project outlines all the copunents needed to create an infinitely scalable serverless data engineering pipeline. While this specific example performs computer vision, the concepts shown can easily be extended to other tasks like natural language processing or involve the use of any other pretrained models.
